# tarkov-kill-confirmer
Confirms kills in Escape from Tarkov using NVIDIA Highlights

# Usage
Download, or build from source, the EXE.
Download NVIDIA GeForce Experience, and enable NVIDIA Highlights.
Open the EXE, make sure the NVIDIA Highlights folder is correct.
Open NVIDIA Highlights, change your settings to only highlight kills (and your own deaths if you'd like!)
Play Tarkov as normal, when you get a kill a second (roughly) later the console window will update, saying you got a kill, and you will hear an audible BEEP sound.
